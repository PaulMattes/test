Welcome to Jupyter-Innotater's documentation!
=============================================

Annotate data including image bounding boxes inline within your `Jupyter
notebook <https://jupyter.org/>`__ in python.

Innotater is a Jupyter notebook extension (widget) for machine learning practitioners. Use Python code to load your
training and test data, then interactively annotate the data by drawing bounding boxes, selecting
classes from a drop-down, or through other Javascript widgets.

Now works in JupyterLab (2.0+ recommended).
